## About Me üê∞

I am a Freshman in High School (14) and I live in the Washington Metro Area. I can code well in Python and a good bit of C++. I am a fast learner and I pick up new technologies and frameworks quickly. I am also on my HS Robotics team and we will be competing in the [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/) this winter. We have an Organizational Repository on here where I maintain and develop our website. We are currently using TypeScript, and React and hosting on Vercel.

## Currently Working On üñ•Ô∏è

Creating the website for my [Robotics team](https://github.com/Ocebots) and Creating the Discord bot for our server. You can find those repos pinned to the top of my profile.
